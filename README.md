# burger

Eat-Da-Burger! is a buger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). The app follows the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

# How it works
Eat-Da-Burger! is a resturant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Wheneber a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area has a 'Devour it!' button. When the user clicks the button, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app stores every burger in a database, wheter devoured or not.
